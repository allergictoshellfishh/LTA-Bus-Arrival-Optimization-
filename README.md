# LTA-Bus-Arrival-Optimization-

This project focuses on designing and deploying a real-time data pipeline using Alteryx Designer, based on live data from the LTA DataMall Bus Arrival API. The goal was to transform raw API responses into a clean, user-friendly output that displays estimated bus arrival times for a given bus stop, which was implemented using PowerBI.

The workflow begins by accepting a bus stop code as input and dynamically constructing the API request. Real-time JSON data is then retrieved, parsed, filtered, and transformed to extract relevant attributes such as bus service number and estimated arrival timings. Data cleansing and formatting steps were applied to ensure the output is easy to interpret and suitable for end users.

This assignment demonstrates practical understanding of the end-to-end data pipelining process, including API integration, data transformation, and real-time data consumption using Alteryx tools. It also reflects the ability to design pipelines based on real-world requirements, handle external data sources, and present insights in a clear and structured manner.
